        As social media is now a part of everyday life, it is important for children and young people to learn how to communicate online to prepare them for future opportunities in the workplace and support them in interacting with friends and family.</p>

        Social media removes the boundaries of meeting and maintaining people and forming bonds beyond borders.
         For children who may have a disability or may not feel they can connect with others within their community, it can be a great way to connect with other people who share their ideas and interests.</p>
